# fin-vue

This is the client, frontend repo for my final project in WDI.

It is pretty basic, it is a SPA (single-page-application) built on Vue2.0js front end framework consuming the backend RESTful API.

It implements JSON web tokens as well and logs the token into localStorage.

It utilises Vue router to render the different components for fake routing.

## Getting Started

You should use this application in conjunction with the backend server API.

```
npm run dev
```
to start the server on http://localhost:8888

from here, log in as a user or register as a user.

### Prerequisites

install the relevant dependencies via

```
npm install --save
```

and npm run dev to start the server if you clone the repo.

## Tests

No tests were written for the frontend.
